## I didn't write this terrible code  🙂
I decided to see how websites are created using the [lovable.dev](https://lovable.dev/) AI.  
The code is poorly written with minimal destructuring. But the design looks pretty good.  
I fixed a few bugs manually. It's a passable tool for quickly implementing an idea for yourself, but not for use in a real product.
